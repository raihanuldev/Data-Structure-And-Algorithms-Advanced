/*
O(n) - Linear Time Complexity: Algorithms with O(n) complexity have a runtime that grows linearly with the input size.
This means that as the input size increases, the runtime of the algorithm increases proportionally. 
An example of O(n) complexity is iterating through an array and performing a specific operation on each element.
